Crop type identification
This project identifies tobacco fields
We use transfer learning to 1) Determine which plants are tobacco in the AOI and 2) Estimate the yields from the AOI
# Notebooks
The most important notebook is the sentinelBackscatterring. 
We used the backscater values measured in decibel of sentinel to identify various crop types
